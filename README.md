Two-O-Player is a math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. Players begin with 3 lives. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life. The game ends when one player has lost all three of their lives.
